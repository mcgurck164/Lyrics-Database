Señor and the Queen - EP,https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858712581/,Senor and the Queen,2008,The Gaslight Anthem,"I wanna know how you dance pretty baby, by the light of the moon
Do you carry your lovers around in a heart like a tomb with a view?
I wanna know how you lose, pretty baby, does it show in your eyes?
Were you born to be a runner, or are you a casual sigh?
Did the boys at school break your precious heart in two?

And in every sad, sad country song
Is there a little bitty piece of 'em still hanging on?
You tell me yours and I'll tell you mine, my dear
And we'll bury these old ghosts here

Where'd you get those eyes?

What do you see with those eyes, pretty darling, in the dead of the night?
Are you saying your prayers or are you glowing like the metal on the edge of the knife?
Baby whose name sounds right on the lips of my queen?
Am I speaking in riddles, or do you feel what I mean?
Are you dying to move, or are you dying to be the one moved?

And would you shake, shake, shake, shake, shake Senora?
If I could make you feel like he used to make you feel
I'll swing you a song and I'll dance you a dance right now

And would you shake, shake, shake, shake, shake Senora?
If I could make you feel like he used to make you feel
I'll swing you a song and I'll dance you a dance right now
And we'll bury these old ghosts down

We'll bury these old ghosts down
Down, down, down
Down, darlin', down
Down, down

Señor and the Queen - EP,https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858712582/,"Wherefore Art Thou, Elvis?",2008,The Gaslight Anthem,"I cut my teeth on the stone of a teenage romance
I was the salt of the earth, I was hard 
The last of the independents

And in the breath from my chest I was blowing kerosene
My lips and fingertips were stone, I wore my heart on my jeans
I sang the blues like the dogs left too long in the street
I still sing the blues with the dogs

And I got half a mind to let it all burn up in this fire
I've had burning through my veins since I first learned to cry
I'd watch this whole night come down and never miss her again
I never felt right and never fit in walkin' in my own skin

Walkin' in my own skin

Now I got scars like the number of stars 
My mind's full of vipers
I got the dust of the desert in my bones 
Comin' through the amplifiers

And in the minor chord fall and the fourth and the fifth
It's a broken Hallelujah and a pain in my fist
I wash my hands like the man with the blood on his teeth
Over and over without relief

And I got nothin' for you darlin' but a story to tell
About the rain on the pavement and the sound as it fell
I'd watch this whole night come down and never miss her again
I never felt right and never fit in

Walkin' in my old man shoes, with my scientist heart
I got a fever and a beaker and a shot in the dark
I need a Cadillac ride, I need a soft summer night
Say a prayer for my soul, Señorita

Walkin' in my old man shoes, with my scientist heart
I got a fever and a beaker and a shot in the dark
I need a Cadillac ride, I need a soft summer night
Say a prayer for my soul, Señorita

'Cause I've been dying out here in the cold and the snow
Got a picture of you, Mama, to remind me of home
On the hood of a Dodge on a Saturday night
Say a prayer for my soul, Señorita

Tonight won't you come down out of your tower?
Don't make me dance all night alone
Alright!

Call up your girlfriends to come out tonight
I'll call up my best friends to come out tonight
We'll put on our best shirts and finest cologne
And we'll turn the Casanova on

Come on out Maria and lose the tragic
Come on out Maria and I'll show you some magic
Meet on the warm sand and waltz out the twilight
And watch the carnival lights explode

We're having a party, everybody's swingin'
Tonight won't you come down out of your tower?
Don't make me dance all night alone

I've seen you from the window around
I can't get your perfume memory out
So come on before we get much older
And that can happen any one of these nights

Before we turn to ghosts on the mist on the sand
Or fall in line for more conducive plans
I never took a shot to the higher minds
But I can hold the soft waltz down

Meet me tonight
Let's see what can happen

We're having a party, everybody's swingin'
Tonight won't you come down out of your tower?
Don't make me dance all night alone

Cause everybody's shaking like the end of the world
And everybody's waiting on the end of the world
And I ain't got a friend, baby, left in the world
Don't make me dance all night alone

We're having a party, everybody's swingin'
Tonight won't you come down out of your tower?
Don't make me dance all night alone

Cause everybody's shaking like the end of the world

We are the heart of Saturday night
We drink from the fountains off the fireworks
Sweat and bone for a better life

We like our choruses sung together
We like our arms in our brothers' arms
Call every girl we ever met Maria
But I only love Virginia's heart

Still we sing with our heroes, 33 rounds per minute
We're never going home until the sun says we're finished
I'll love you forever if I ever love at all
Wild hearts, blue jeans, & white t-shirts

Some things baby never told you
Some things papa done ain't right
Spent a lifetime just to get over
You always said my mama tried

Still we sing with our heroes, 33 rounds per minute
We're never going home until the sun says we're finished
I'll love you forever if I ever love at all
With wild hearts, blue jeans, & white t-shirts

So tonight I'll call you from a Fourth Street payphone
We'll sleep on the beach if we ain't got a ride
Someday I'll buy you that house on Cookman
We could sleep on the beach all night

Sleep on the beach if we ain't got a ride
Sleep on the beach all night
Sleep on the beach all night
Sleep on the beach if we ain't got a ride

I thought about you
I thought about a friend who passed
And how much we just went through

I saw the sun shine off the hood of a Cadillac
I thought about some things I said
And some I would take back
I thought about how fortunate I feel to be alive

And if you're scared of the future tonight
We'll just take it each hour one at a time
It's a pretty good night for a drive
So dry up those eyes, dry up those eyes

Because the radio will still play loud
Songs that we heard as our guards came down
Like in the summertime when we first met
I'll never forget, and don't you forget
These nights are still ours

I still love the way you smile
I still love the ocean
We should remember to slow down more often
And maybe we will

Now here's a lot of good things coming our way right now
A lot of bad has passed 
But we survived the breakdowns
All is forgiven, water under bridges now

And if you're scared of the future tonight

Darlin' this heart is on fire
And this life is but a dream

I fell in love with the Shrewsbury stars
But there's far too many diamonds
In the backseats of borrowed cars

I could never stand the weather

And you ain't never had a song you could sing
Well it's a deep dark night and I hear you, I've been there

And these are the songs that we sing
Oh, these are the songs that we sing
You've never seen a two-step
Like when you've seen it from your mama's house

Where the kids flash like lightning
To the very best dancers around
We learned from the very best dancers around
We learned from the very best dancers in town
Come take my hand, cause mama, we came to dance

I'm a bleed a little poison out
I'm a cry a little river down
And then I'm setting this whole thing on fire

And I'm burning up the night she died
And I'm putting every last picture aside
I'm gonna say what I need to say
In my very last letter to you

'Cause you always made it clear
Said that you'd never be my pain
So here's to you and your bright baby blues
And just a pause to cool the refrain

And you said you were satisfied
And now this body's just waiting to die
And that you missed him sometimes but you said it's alright
It's just a whole lot harder alone

But I wish you knew her now
She's a better side of me now
And I'm doing the best I can
It's what you wanted

And I see you like you were there
And I know just how you'd smile
Mary, you looked just like it was 1930 that night

But here the days will eat you alive
But I won't give in tonight
You said it's not worth my time
And not to regard them

And not to settle just for piece of mind
But I can wait it out all night
If you'll just keep breathing

But Mary I found a sound
And this heart keeps pouring it out
And the glory hasn't come and it's probably gonna fade 
Like a tattoo that hides the shame 

And the reasons always fade
And the pain gets out some day
So I'm saying my goodbyes to your deep blue eyes
'Cause I don't know how to say, ""Stay still in the pain.
Stay still in the pain.""

But I wish you knew her now
She's a better side of me now
And I'm doing the best I can
It's what you wanted

And I see you like you were there
And I know just how you'd smile
Mary, you looked just like it was 1930 that night

Before it broke up, before it took you from me
And you said, ""I love you more than the stars in the sky
But your name just escapes me tonight.""

My first sin was a young American girl

And I spent time 'neath the trestles
With the punks and the dime store saints
Kept faith and a switchblade stuffed beneath my coat
And I ran with dirty angels, slept out in the rain
We were scared and tired and barely 17

And my first sin was a fear that made me old
My first sin was a fear that made me old

Near the place where I was born

By the light on the Navesink banks
Sayin' ""Listen baby, I know you now""

Thinkin' 'bout a ghost I hear at night

No I would never, never, never leave your heart

And I learned about the blues from this kitten I knew
Her hair was raven and her heart was like a tomb

My heart's like a wound

And I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my first wife
Everybody leaves and I'd expect as much from you
I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my old life
Everybody leaves, so why, why wouldn't you?

Mary, I worried and stalled every night of my life
Better safe than making the party
And I never had a good time, I sat by my bedside
With papers and poetry about Estella

With great expectations
We had the greatest of expectations

And I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my first wife
Everybody leaves and I'd expect as much from you
I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my old life
Everybody leaves, so why, why wouldn't you?

It's funny how the night moves
Humming a song from 1962

We were always waiting
Always waiting
We were always waiting for something to happen

I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my first wife
Everybody leaves and I'd expect as much from you
I saw tail lights last night in a dream about my old life
Everybody leaves and why, why wouldn't you?

See, I was playing a show down the road
When your spirit left your body.

And I can feel it comin' up as the night's gettin' warm
I saw your summer dress hangin' on the back of the lawn
Like a dream I remember from an easier time
With the top rolled down on a Saturday night

And stole the temple that the schoolboys praised
And the crowd shuffled in
You're getting drinks for the same boys who once bought you everything

You've been feeling that he says they'll never know
And you say the night just got too cold

Who's gonna keep my baby warm
When everybody goes?

Wait a minute, wait a minute
(Wasn't I good to you?)
Wait a minute, wait a minute

See what man you can make of me
I will eventually haunt you
And you'll eventually will be my queen

The dark so that you do not
Go through the dark alone
On your own

I've been down at Biloxi Parish
And that's good enough for me
I found that nothing truly matters
That you cannot find for free
I love you more than can I tell you
When you pass through from this world
I hope you ask to take me with you
So I don't have to wait for long

But until then I'll be with you through the dark
And until then I'll be with you through the dark

And who else can say that about you, baby
Who else can say that about you, now
And who else can take all your blood and your curses
Nobody I've seen ya hanging around
Seen ya hanging around

And all of our heroes with failures of ghosts
Burn down in brilliant explosions alone
And all of the blood and the sweat that they gave
Well we took it all and we threw it away

And who else can say that about you, baby
Who else can say that about you, now
And who else can take all your blood and your curses

To be the very thing he perceives would capture your heart?

I would give anything for the touch of your skin
Yes, I would burn here for years
Up in desire, desire

What makes a woman believe in a man such as me?
Unworthy to sit at your foot or your crown
I can only let you down, I can only let you down

What does it feel like inside?
Does it hurt you at night?
Or does it keep you alive and set you on fire, on fire?
I would give anything for the touch of your skin
Yes, I would burn here for years
Up in desire, desire

And some men spend their lives
Chasing the accolades of pride
But that just never crossed my mind,
You were always on my mind, you were always on my mind

And I met you between the wax and the needle and the words of my favorite song
And your black hair was like a raven to your tanned skin over the beach
And your back drop with your rollers and my side kick was all discrete

And I've been so locked down, I've been long lost level on the ground
Where did you get them scars? How blue is your heart?

Did it take you to the carnival to get locked up on the line?

It took years, my baby, just to come clean, every street light a reminder
And all those apologies and the night was lonely next to mean

Twenty-five was a good time but I'm older now
How did I get so lost in the middle of the night?
Oh where've you been all my life?

Around here, they pick me up and let me down
Pour some salt in your wounds and then lay you out
I've never seen anybody get out of this town for life

But I'd sure like to show you around
Where the moon lays the ocean down
But if you've got someone to see,
I don't mean to hold you up

When you finally finish feeling sorry for yourself
They come on and give you a reason to feel sorry for yourself
So I moved away from home to get away from it all
Found out the blues can follow me

In a big old Buick like our fathers had
Turns out we're just like our fathers, babe, well look at that

And I'd sure like to show you around
This old heart loves you now
But if you've got someone to see,
I don't mean to hold you up

Twenty pounds of curses came to visit me tonight.
Salt for all the cuts, blankets for the cold.
Prayers to keep the devil far away from those I love.
And there were red violins, playing in my dreams.
One for me and two for me, and one at Jesus' feet.
And one I only reach to for sympathy.

And if you want it, then you want it.
For when you're falling on your knees.
I seen you howling now, you water at the mouth.
I seen you fawn and faint in need.
Are there red violins playing you sleep?

Chariot swing low, if you come for me.
Ain't it now, the strangest sound we call on for relief?
Look at the all these people clapping steady to the beat,
Of the ambulances on their way to me

So if you wanna, then you wanna.
Everybody pays the price to feed.
And since you're howling now, you're foaming at the mouth
And since you're struck right off your feet.
I'll play red violins

And you are now of my existence,
You're part of that which still remains.
And you're lingering like fingered strings,
I seem to call on to feel the pain.
On red violins, on red violins.

And if you wanna, then you wanna.
Can't you see me crawling at your feet?
You see me howling now, I'm foaming at the mouth.
Come on and grieve for my disease
And there were red violins playing in my dreams.
There were red violins playing in my dreams.
There were red violins.

And they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
I called for my father but my father had died
While you told me fortunes, in American Slang

Look at the damage,
The fortunes came for the richer men.
While we're left with gallows,
Waiting for us liars to come down and hang.

And when it was over, I woke up alone

And they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
I called for my father but my father had died
While you told me fortunes, in American Slang

And here's where we died that time last year,
And here's where the angels and devils meet.
And you can dance with the queen if you need,
And she will always keep your cards
Close to her heart ooh
So close to her heart before they tear you apart

When they cut me to ribbons and taught me to drive
I got your name tattooed inside of my arm
And I called for my father but my father had died
I called for my father but my father had died
While you told me fortunes, in American Slang
You told me fortunes, in American Slang

The B-Sides,https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/3530822107858825559/,Boxer,2014,The Gaslight Anthem,"Got your pride and your prose
Tucked just like a Tommy gun
Somewhere in the smoke
Just in case you need it
I know you got your pride and your prose
Tucked just like a Tommy gun
Somewhere in the smoke
Just in case you needed
Some of her to spin around
Rougher than the last one
Oh, what'd you used to say
The harder they come
But he just swears he's praying for a good time
He, he said he just doesn't miss her
And I have heard you never really lose it
Do you, do you

He took it all gracefully on the chin
Knowing that the beatings had to someday end
He found the bandages inside the pen
And the stitches on the radio
There was something, baby, holding you down
And there were whispers that were driving you crazy
And now you hunt the heart of this town
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby

And you tied two knuckles up
How they grind down
Tried to be a man
Tough just like your father
Try to settle down
Boy, I could calm down
Remember them songs
And the reasons we were singing
But he said he just doesn't miss her
He, he said it's somewhere in his framework
And I have heard you never really lose it
Do you, do you

He took it all gracefully on the chin
Knowing that the beatings had to someday end
He found the bandages inside the pen
And the stitches on the radio
There was something, baby, holding you down
And there were reasons that were driving you crazy
Until you hunt the heart of this town
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby

And you can wait all night long
Until it all goes wrong
And you waste away your soul
And you can wait, wait, wait, wait

You took it all gracefully on the chin
Knowing that the beatings had to someday end
You found the bandages inside the pen
And the stitches on the radio
There was something, baby, holding you down
And there were whispers that were driving you crazy
Until you hunt the heart of this town
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby
Remember when I knew a boxer, baby

I was in love with you, lady and you treated me so cool.
I was drivin' a Chevy '72 had 4 on the floor, girl,
One hundred 20 it would do

I remember Marvin Gaye, singin',
What's goin' on

There was a war, baby, somewhere across the sea
I didn't wanna go and fight, girl, but you were really lovin' me.
I remember Martin Luther King,
Lord he was the man, baby, that gave us all a dream.

I remember Marvin Gaye, singin',
What's goin' on
Don't play with my love no,
I remember Marvin Gaye, singin', What's goin' on

We used to have sweet music in the park
Lord up at Monterey a they sang throughout the dark
You used to wear girl, those hot pants
When you strolled down the hall,
All the boys wanted a chance...

I remember Marvin Gaye, singin',
What's goin' on
Don't play with my love, no
I remember Otis Redding, Sittin' at the Dock of the Bay
Ahh, he went away..
I remember Sam Cooke ya'll, Bring It On Home To Me,
From your love I can't be free
I remember Elvis Presley, and the Blue Suede Shoes
Ahh it gave me the blues.
I remember Marvin Gaye, singin' Let's get it on
