Don't say a single world, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night
Like I was a ghost in your dreams

And it was all completely wrong, Virginia
You were much too much for me
I was a boy on the lawn, with his eyes to the sky
You were Garbo, smoke, and deceit

And it was Saturday, September, and fire
It was a backdrop set in your smile
It was all I could want in the sway of the song
I was haunted for so many years

Let it ride, let it ride, let it roll off your mind
Don't say a single world, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night
Like I was a ghost in your dreams

Say goodbye, say goodbye, give a kiss and a sigh
Never, never, never bring me back to your mind
Let it slide, slide, roll off your mind
Like I was a movie you'd seen

And it was all just a crime, Virginia
Let your fire be mercy to me
I was a boy in your arms, safe in your arms
And you swore like a promise to me

That I would never, never, never leave your heart
No I would never, never, never leave your heart
But where are you now, I can still feel you now 
And I hear all your songs in the breeze

Let it ride, let it ride, let it roll off your mind
Don't say a single world, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night
Like I was a ghost in your dreams

Say goodbye, say goodbye, give a kiss and a sigh
Never, never, never bring me back to your mind
Let me slide, slide, roll off your mind
Like I was a movie you'd seen

I was a boy in your arms, safe in your arms

No I would never, never, never leave your heart
But where are you now, I can still feel you now 
And I hear all your songs in the breeze

Let it ride, let it ride, let it roll off your mind
Don't say a single world, get back inside
Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night
Like I was a ghost in your dreams

Say goodbye, say goodbye, give a kiss and a sigh
Never, never, never bring me back to your mind

Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night

And it was all just a crime, Virginia
Let your fire be mercy to me
I was a boy in your arms, safe in your arms
And you swore like a promise to me

No I would never, never, never leave your heart

Let me drive, let me drive, disappear in the night
Like I was a ghost in your dreams

And it was all completely wrong, Virginia
You were much too much for me
I was a boy on the lawn, with his eyes to the sky
You were Garbo, smoke, and deceit

And it was Saturday, September, and fire
It was a backdrop set in your smile
It was all I could want in the sway of the song
I was haunted for so many years

Let your fire be mercy to me
I was a boy in your arms, safe in your arms
And you swore like a promise to me

That I would never, never, never leave your heart
No I would never, never, never leave your heart
But where are you now, I can still feel you now 
And I hear all your songs in the breeze
